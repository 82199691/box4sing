This project is a [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk), [Kernelsu](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU), [APatch](https://github.com/bmax121/APatch) module for Clash, sing-box, v2ray, xray, hysteria. It supports REDIRECT (TCP only), TPROXY (TCP + UDP) transparent proxy, TUN (TCP + UDP), and hybrid mode REDIRECT (TCP) + TUN (UDP) proxy.

Based on upstream integration for one-stop service, ready to use. Suitable for:
- Lazy people
- Beginners

The project's theme and configuration focus on [Clash.Meta](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/Clash.Meta).

This module needs to be used in a Magisk/Kernelsu environment. If you don't know how to configure the required environment, you might need applications like ClashForAndroid, v2rayNG, surfboard, SagerNet, AnXray.

## Wiki

<details>
<summary>1. First Use</summary>

- After successfully adding the subscription address, restart your phone. The complete rule files may not be automatically downloaded due to network issues. Manually navigate to the rule page at the bottom right of the proxy page on the Web App and click the refresh icon to update/download rule files. If you cant use the app due to network issues, please copy and open it in a browser
  - `127.0.0.1:9090/ui`
  - If the above fails, try switching the module on and make sure your network environment is normal.
- Web AppÔºö[Download](https://github.com/MoGuangYu/Surfing/raw/main/folder/Web_v5.5_release.apk) | [View Source Code](./folder/main.lua)
  - It is only a graphical tool for portable browsing and managing backend routing data, with no other additional uses.

> The module has a built-in GUI that can be accessed locally via a browser or used online with the app, with no essential difference between the two.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Control Operation</summary>

- You can control the operation service in real time by toggling the module on/off.

</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Geo Database</summary>

GitHub Actions automatically build daily at 6 AM Beijing time, ensuring the latest rules. [Wiki](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/meta-rules-dat)

> Used for routing rule matching to achieve accurate diversion. Updates will always point to the latest version, so you only need to update the file once a month.

</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Subsequent Updates</summary>

- Supports online module updates in the client.
- No need to restart after updating, but toggling the module on/off might temporarily fail, still requiring a restart.
- The Clash.Meta config.yaml configuration file is backed up during updates to
   - `/data/adb/box_bll/clash/config.yaml.bak`
- User configuration files are backed up during updates to
   - `/data/adb/box_bll/scripts/box.config.bak`
- Updating the module will not overwrite any database files.
- For database file updates, manually update in the Web panel - Configuration Options page.

> Mainly follow upstream updates and issue some configurations.

</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Usage Issues</summary>

1. Proxy Specific Applications (Black/Whitelist)
- To proxy all applications except certain ones, open the `/data/adb/box_bll/scripts/box.config` file, set the `proxy_mode` value to `blacklist` (default), and add elements to the `user_packages_list` array. The format for elements is `id:package_name`, separated by spaces. For example, `user_packages_list=("id:package_name" "id:package_name")` to **not proxy** specific Android user applications.

- To only proxy specific applications, open the `/data/adb/box_bll/scripts/box.config` file, set the `proxy_mode` value to `whitelist`, and add elements to the `user_packages_list` array. The format for elements is `id:package_name`, separated by spaces. For example, `user_packages_list=("id:package_name" "id:package_name")` to **only proxy** specific Android user applications.

Android user group ID identifiers:

| Standard User | ID  |
| ------------- | --- |
| Owner         |  0  |
| Second Space  |  10 |
| App Clone     | 999 |

> Typically, you can find all user group IDs and application package names in `/data/user/`. Do not use fake-ip mode when using black/whitelist.

2. Tun Mode
- Enabled by default

> Recommended to enable under WiFi. If not necessary, it can be disabled. Do not use black/whitelist before enabling this mode.

3. Routing Rules
- Bypass mainland China
- Updated daily

> Black/whitelist is not significant unless strictly required. The module's built-in configuration is sufficient.

4. Panel Management
- Magisk Font Module

> May affect normal display of page fonts.

5. LAN Sharing
- Enable hotspot to allow other devices to connect.

> For other devices to access the console backend, just use (http://currentWiFigateway:9090/ui).
